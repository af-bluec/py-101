# py-101

A comprehensive Python demonstration script showcasing fundamental programming concepts and features.

## Overview

This project contains a Python script that demonstrates various Python programming concepts, from basic operations to more advanced features. It's designed as an educational resource for learning Python fundamentals.

## Features

The `main.py` script demonstrates:

### Basic Concepts
- Variable assignments and data types
- Functions and function calls
- Control flow (if/else statements, loops)
- Exception handling (try/except/finally blocks)

### Data Structures
- Lists and list methods
- Dictionaries and dictionary operations
- Sets and set operations
- Tuples and tuple unpacking

### Functions and Programming Concepts
- Recursive functions (factorial, countdown)
- Lambda functions
- List comprehensions
- Generator expressions
- Decorators (simple example)

### Mathematical Operations
- Prime number checking
- Fibonacci sequence generation
- Factorial calculation
- Basic arithmetic operations

### Object-Oriented Programming
- Class definition and instantiation
- Method creation and usage
- Object interaction

### Advanced Features
- Higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce)
- Context manager simulation
- Error handling and custom exceptions
- String manipulation and formatting
- Random number generation
- Date operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher

### Running the Script

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd py-101
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Script Output

When you run the script, you'll see output demonstrating:

- Mathematical calculations (factorial, prime checks, Fibonacci sequence)
- Data structure manipulations
- String operations
- Random number generation
- Error handling examples
- Class usage demonstrations
- And much more!

## Educational Value

This script is particularly useful for:

- **Beginners**: Learning Python syntax and basic concepts
- **Students**: Understanding fundamental programming principles
- **Educators**: Having a comprehensive example to reference
- **Developers**: Quick reference for Python features

## Code Structure

The script is organized into logical sections:

1. **Import statements**: Standard library imports
2. **Function definitions**: Reusable functions demonstrating various concepts
3. **Main execution block**: Examples of all features in action
4. **Class definitions**: Object-oriented programming examples

## Key Learning Points

- **Functions**: How to define and use functions effectively
- **Data Types**: Working with numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, and sets
- **Control Flow**: Using loops, conditionals, and exception handling
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Basic class creation and usage
- **Functional Programming**: Lambda functions, map, filter, and reduce
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception management
- **Python Idioms**: List comprehensions, context managers, and decorators

- **Spam or self-promotion** without contributing value to the community
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered **inappropriate in a professional setting**

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

- Using an official e-mail address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Contributing to the project repository
- Participating in project discussions
- Mentoring or helping other contributors

- **Multiple learning styles** accommodated through various examples and documentation
- **Progressive complexity** in examples and exercises

### Knowledge Sharing
- **Teaching through code** - prioritize readable, educational examples
- **Documentation that teaches** - explain not just what, but why
- **Mentoring mindset** - help others grow their skills
- **Collaborative learning** - we all learn from each other

### Quality and Excellence
- **Code that demonstrates best practices**
- **Examples that are both correct and educational**
- **Clear, comprehensive documentation**
- **Thorough testing** to ensure reliability

## Enforcement

### Reporting Guidelines

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS].

When reporting, please include:
- **Description of the incident**
- **When and where it occurred** 
- **Any relevant context or background**
- **Screenshots or links** if applicable
- **Any other information** you think would be helpful

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Privacy and Confidentiality

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Positive Community Examples

### Encouraging Interactions

**Great ways to help newcomers:**
```
"Welcome to the project! Your question about string manipulation is great. 
Here's how the clean_text function works... [explanation]. 
Also check out our examples in docs/EXAMPLES.md for more use cases!"
```

**Constructive code review:**
```
"This function works well! A couple suggestions:
1. Consider adding type hints for better clarity
2. The edge case handling could be more explicit
Here's an example of what I mean... [code example]
Great contribution overall!"
```

**Helpful issue responses:**
```
"Thanks for reporting this bug! I can reproduce the issue. 
It looks like it's related to handling empty lists in the flatten_list function.
Would you like to work on fixing this, or should I assign it to someone else?"
```

### Learning-Focused Interactions

**Teaching through examples:**
```python
# Instead of just saying "use list comprehension"
# Show both approaches for educational value:

# Traditional approach (easier to understand):
result = []
for item in items:
    if item > 0:
        result.append(item * 2)

# List comprehension (more Pythonic):
result = [item * 2 for item in items if item > 0]

# Both achieve the same goal, but comprehensions are more concise
```

**Encouraging exploration:**
```
"Great question! The fibonacci_sequence function uses iteration, 
but you could also implement it recursively. Try both approaches and 
see which one you find clearer. Here's a hint for the recursive version..."
```
